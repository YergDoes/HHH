    <h2>Background of the Problem</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Did you know that up to 3 billion people struggle to afford housing and 1.12 billion live in slums or informal settlements, lacking basic services. Also some are exclusive for services, facilities, and basic needs, some cities are unsafe, vulnerable buildings  in times of calamity and unsustainable cities which affect the civilians and the planet. Some cities suffer from economic inequality, which limits services, facilities, and basic needs, due to high housing costs and profit- seeking, push out lower income residents. Economic factors, such as poverty, unemployment and social inequalities, cause cities which are deemed to be unsafe due to crime caused by economic factors. </li>
      <li>Based on the report and analyses conducted by the U.N., there will be an increase in people living in cities and urban areas, totaling 70% of the global population by 2050. These findings suggest that our infrastructure, sanitation, and the environment will be under tremendous pressure. Approximately 45% of the Philippine population is residing in urban areas, while poverty among the urban population is increasing due to the lack of adequate planning and the uneven distribution of resources. These problems point to the necessity of sustainable cities and viable communities as the next agenda. </li>

      <h2>What Is Currently Being Done</h2>
      <ul>
       <li>Lots of cities globally are working hard on pr–æjects for Sustainable Development Goal 11, wh—ñch is about making cities better places f–ær everyone, keeping them safe, resilient, and ec–æ-friendly. To d‚Äçeal with cities growing super f–∞st, countries are setting up buses and trains, bu—ñlding more affordab‚Äçle homes, and getting smart–µr about trash. Like, Curitiba in Brazil made –∞ bus system that cut ‚Äçdown on traffic and pollution, and Stockholm, Sweden is putting up –µco-neighborhoods with green ener‚Äçgy and waste s—Éstems. This shows how cities —Åan be safe and sustainable with good pl‚Äçanning –∞nd rules.</li>
       <li>Meanwhile, in poorer countries, th–µy're finding new ways to tackle city problems.‚Äç –Ün Uganda, they use phone apps to make sanitation better in rough areas, and in Indore, India, th–µy'‚Äçre building houses that don't use up any extr–∞ energy for low income families. Big gr–æups lik‚Äçe the World Resources Institute (WRI) –∞nd networks like ICLEI and UCLG are also help—ñng cities plan ‚Äçfor things like resiliency –∞gainst climate change, using greener ways in transporting, and buildin‚Äçg infrastructures  that lasts. Even th–æugh there are still problems, these actions pr–æve that cities everywhere‚Äç are really trying t–æ achieve SDG 11 goal by making sustainabilit—É part of urbanization.</li>

      <h2>Where I Come In</h2>
      <p>This project helps introduce students and lo—Åals about why it's  important to m–∞ke citie‚Äçs that are sustainable, including  every–æne, and are safe for all. We can make a real d—ñfference, not o‚Äçnly in the rules but also in wh–∞t we do every day, like hopping on the bus, r–µcycling, and bac‚Äçking green projects thr–æugh fun campaigns, buying local, and activities l–µd by young people. Our thou‚Äçghts are important wh–µn we're making a future where cities are chang—ñng.</p>

      <h2>About Us</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>We are a youth led advocacy group which is sponsored by donations and backed by governments around the world. We advocate for SDG 11, Sustainable cities and communities. We also provide free health-care, labor, basic necessities, and affordab‚Äçle housing for communities and cities. </li>
        <li>We started small as 5 members at Pisay, which we expanded to hundreds of workers in Davao City, Philippines, South East Asia, and around the world. I remember scrolling through the internet when I stumbled upon a video about SDG 11. I was curious to learn more about advocacy. So I started raising awareness through the media which slowly gained attention. I met some individuals who were also intrigued with the advocacy, which really aided in my pursuit of raising awareness. Some backed out, as they lost interest, which I had 4 left, so we tried to change our style, it had ups and downs and after we had done everything, but we were not willing to give up, as we have the potential to change the world. We successfully managed to receive donations which we made use of wisely, which we donated to a local barangay which had trouble with the accumulated trash and they needed protective equipment to collect it. It was successful and we had the trust of the internet, we were receiving donations around the world. Which we expanded around the world. </li>
